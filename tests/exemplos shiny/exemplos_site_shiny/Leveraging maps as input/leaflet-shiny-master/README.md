# Leaflet bindings for Shiny

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) is an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

[Shiny](http://rstudio.com/shiny) is an open-source R framework for interactive webapps.

This R package makes it easy to integrate and control Leaflet maps from Shiny applications. [Here's an example application](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/jcheng/leaflet-demo) (see inst/example for the source).
